/* You are given a list of studentsâ€™ names and their test scores. Design an algorithm
that does the following:

a.) Calculates the average test scores.
b.) Determines and prints the names of all the students whose test scores are
below the average test score.

c.) Determines the highest test score.
d.) Prints the names of all the students whose test scores are the same as the
highest test score.

(You must divide this problem into subproblems as follows: The first subproblem
determines the average test score. The second subproblem determines and prints the
names of all the students whose test scores are below the average test score. The third
subproblem determines the highest test score. The fourth subproblem prints the names
of all the students whose test scores are the same as the highest test score. The main
algorithm combines the solutions of the subproblems.) */
