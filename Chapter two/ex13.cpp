/* A permutation of three objects, a, b, and c, is any arrangement of these
objects in a row. For example, some of the permutations of these objects
are abc, bca, and cab. The number of permutations of three objects is six.
Suppose that these three objects are strings. Write a program that prompts
the user to enter three strings. The program then outputs the six permu-
tations of those strings. */
